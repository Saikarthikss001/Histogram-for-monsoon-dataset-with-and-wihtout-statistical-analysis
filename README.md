              Title: Rainfall Classification & Histogram Analysis for Wet and Dry Days



Description:
This repository contains Python code for generating histograms to compare rainfall distributions between wet and dry days. The project aims to visualize and analyze the patterns of rainfall across two distinct categories—wet and dry days—using rainfall data.

Key Features:
Histograms for Wet and Dry Days:
Separate histograms for wet and dry days showing the frequency distribution of rainfall.
Two versions of histograms are provided:
Without Statistical Analysis: Simple histograms based on rainfall data.
With Statistical Analysis: Histograms of statistical features such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and rainfall to compare wet vs dry conditions.


Visualizations:
Comparison of wet and dry day rainfall distributions using clear and intuitive plots.


Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. matplotlib library for plotting

Usage:

pip install matplotlib
Run the main Python script using the following command

python main_script.py

The script will generate histograms comparing wet and dry day rainfall distributions.


Output:
Side-by-side histograms for wet and dry days showing rainfall distributions.
Comparison of statistical features such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
